We're excited to announce today that GitHub has joined the growing list of sponsors for GopherCon 2014.

GitHub has a long history of supporting the programming community, and their sponsorship of GopherCon extends their reach into the Go community as well.  GitHub is even making their <a href="http://techno-weenie.net/2013/11/2/key-value-logs-in-go/">first forays</a> into using Go internally.

Please join us in welcoming GitHub to the growing list of sponsors helping us to bring you the best possible conference for Go developers.
