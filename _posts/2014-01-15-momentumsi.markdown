Today we're excited to announce that MomentumSI has signed up to be a Bronze sponsor of GopherCon 2014.

>MomentumSI is a boutique consultancy headquartered out of Austin, TX with a knack for solving complex engineering problems. If it's routine, they automate it and if it's disruptive, they accelerate it. Go's efficiency and simplicity make it a preferred language at Momentum for client infrastructure automation and simian-style chaos testing.

Thank you to everyone at MomentumSI for your support and sponsorship of GopherCon 2014!
