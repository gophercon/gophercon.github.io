We're excited to announce today that Canonical is sponsoring GopherCon 2014 as a Diamond Sponsor.

>Canonical is the company behind the Ubuntu operating system and the leading provider of support services for Ubuntu deployments in enterprise, OEM and telco sectors. Ubuntu is an open-source platform for client, server and cloud computing - including mobile devices and smartphones, as announced most recently. Since its launch in 2004, it has become a natural choice for users of all kinds, from Fortune 500 companies to hardware makers, content providers, software developers and individuals.

We appreciate the support that Canonical is providing for the conference.
