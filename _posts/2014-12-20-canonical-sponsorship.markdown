We're excited to announce today that Canonical is sponsoring GopherCon 2014 as a Diamond Sponsor.

>Canonical is the company behind the Ubuntu operating system and the leading provider of support services for Ubuntu deployments in enterprise, OEM and telco sectors. Ubuntu is an open-source platform for client, server and cloud computing - including mobile devices and smartphones, as announced most recently. Since its launch in 2004, it has become a natural choice for users of all kinds, from Fortune 500 companies to hardware makers, content providers, software developers and individuals.

>Since shortly after the Go language was publicly announced, Canonical
started researching about the possibility of turning the language into
a preferred choice for its internally developed products. Nowadays, Go
has become the main choice for sever-side projects within the company,
including relevant infrastructure systems such as
[juju](http://juju.ubuntu.com), and there is also on going research to
introduce [Go on the client side](http://github.com/niemeyer/qml).
It's clear from these efforts that our experience is a positive
one, and we want to see the language thriving.

>We're thankful for the great work done by the core development team
and the community around it, and are excited to have the community
organizing a conference specific to the Go language.

We appreciate the support that Canonical is providing for the conference and the community.
