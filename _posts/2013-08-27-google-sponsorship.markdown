Today we're excited to announce that Google has signed up to be our first Diamond sponsor.  Google is showing its committment to the Go language by sponsoring GopherCon 2014 and providing not one, but two keynote speakers.  Both Andrew Gerrand and Rob Pike will be presenting keynote talks at our first conference.

As Go developers, we're indebted to Google for opening up the language for the world to use and for fostering an environment that makes it easy to contribute both to the language and to the ecosystem surrounding Go.

We'd like to thank Andrew Gerrand from the Go team for helping us navigate through the org chart at Google to get us in contact with the right people to make this sponsorship happen.

Please join us in welcoming Google to the list of GopherCon sponsors.
