We haven't sent an update in a few months so we are stepping away from our vim sessions for a minute to let you know what's going on in the world of GopherCon.  We have some great updates to share with you!

- We've got our first confirmed sponsor : Iron.io  While we have at least half a dozen other companies in various stages of getting sponsorship packages put together, Iron.io was the first to get the deal done.  We're proud to be sponsored by such a great company -- especially one that uses Go so effectively to service their customers.  If you bump into Ken or Travis, give them a high five for believing in the Go community!
- Early-bird ticket pricing ends soon.  We have a set limit of advanced-purchase tickets at the sweet rate of $250.  When these are gone (and they're going fast) ticket pricing will go up to $299.  Don't delay, save a Ulysses S. Grant and register today!
- Keynote Presentations : Andrew Gerrand and Rob Pike have graciously volunteered to provide our opening and closing talks at GopherCon 2014.  This isn't some slapped-together meetup in the back room of Joe's Crab Shack, this is the real deal, Gophers.
- New GopherCon website:  We've got a great new design for a GopherCon website that we'll be rolling out in the next week or so.  You can see the sponsors, as well as the few confirmed speakers we've selected.  It's much prettier, and we hope you'll like it as much as we do.
- Call for Proposals:  The new website will feature our CFP, so you can submit your proposal to speak at GopherCon.  If you want to get your proposal in earlier, you can go here to submit one today.  Put on your best creative hat and tell us what you want to share with the Go community.

We're working hard behind the scenes to make this an awesome opportunity to learn from fellow Go users and network with friends you may only know online.  The third day of the conference is going to be a "hack-day" in the conference space, with unorganized networking and hacking encouraged.  Stay an extra day and join your Go friends hacking on cool projects.  Network, hob-knob, and maybe find your next Go gig while you're at it.

Those are the updates for now.  Check our website shortly for the new design.  We can't wait to see you in Denver in 2014!
