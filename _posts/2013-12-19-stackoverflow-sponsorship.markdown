We're excited to announce today that Stack Overflow has joined the list of sponsors for GopherCon 2014.

Stack Overflow is the largest website for professional programmers and attracts more than 25 million visitors each month. Careers 2.0 lets developers create profiles that highlight their work on Stack Overflow and open source sites, giving employers an in-depth look at their expertise. Employers can use Careers 2.0 to post open tech positions or search for programmers by location, objective, and skills through our invite-only candidate database.

Thanks Stack Overflow!
