Today we're excited to announce that Stripe has signed up to be a Bronze sponsor of GopherCon 2014.

>Stripe is the best way to accept payments online. Stripe aims to expand internet commerce by making it easy to process transactions and manage an online business.

Stripe also purchased 5(!) tickets in support of our GopherCon 2014 Scholarship for women.  We really appreciate that they share our vision for GopherCon.

Thank you to everyone at Stripe for your support and sponsorship of GopherCon 2014!
