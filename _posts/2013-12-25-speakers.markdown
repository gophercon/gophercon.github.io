## Saturday April 26th

On April 26th, we have a room reseved with just one thing in mind: making it easy for you to spend time hacking, networking, talking, and having fun with your favorite Gopher friends.  Maybe you'll want to organize lightning talks in the morning?  Maybe you'll get together with the contributors to your Open Source project that you've never met in person?  Whatever you do you'll be spending the day with Gophers from across the globe!

## Thank You To Everyone Who Submitted Talks

Submitting a proposal to a conference is a little intimidating, we know.  We'd like to personally thank the 70+ people who submitted proposals to speak at GopherCon 2014.  There's no doubt that each of the proposals we received would have made a great talk.  The breadth, depth, and quality of the proposals was amazing.  

## Thank You To The Reviewers

A special thank you to the community reviewers who helped us narrow down the 70+ proposals to a list of finalists.  You each spent a lot of time going through these proposals, and we appreciate it!

We'll update the website with full details of speakers and talks after the holiday.

See you in Denver!
