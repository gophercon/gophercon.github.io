It's exciting when your baby takes its first steps.  Our little Gopher took a step in the right direction today when we signed up the great folks at [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) to be our first sponsors.  Travis Reeder has been a long time proponent of Go, and it's going to be no surprise to the Go community that he and his company have stepped forward to take the first sponsorship slot for GopherCon 2014.

From their site:

>Iron.io is the maker of IronMQ, the message queue for the cloud. It is a scalable cloud-based message queue service designed for building distributed cloud applications quickly and operating at scale. Iron.ioâ€™s services are easy to use, highly available, and require no setup or maintenance. This translates into greater speed to market, reduced complexity, and increased reliability and scalability.
	


We're proud to have [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) as one of sponsors.  The engineers at [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) are not only building reliable queue services for their customers, but they are putting out great open source software for Go, and their support of the Go community has set an example of how a great technology company can interact with the software ecosystem surrounding it.
