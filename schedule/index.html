          <p>
		  	We discuss the Go Circuit project and set it in the context of an inevitable and oncoming shift in the development and runtime stacks of the Internet age. We argue that the programming language is the right place to abstract access to a hardware clusters as a "Single-System Image". On the way, we appeal to the success of Erlang in the Telecom industry and discuss why it has not yet inspired Internet-age counterparts. Somewhat unlike Erlang, where the distributed operating system OTP is below the language, we assert that the distributed OS should be built above and using the language. We conclude with an important high-level observation that single desktop machines are qualitatively identical and only quantitatively different than distributed hardware clusters, in terms of the semantics of their behavior in the presence of failures.

        Channels are Go's communication mechanism and the standard way for goroutines to communicate. But there are many uses of a channel that go beyond simply sending data to a goroutine.
        <p>This talk will start with the basics of channel communication and work through examples of channels as buffers, channels as memory managers, channels as signaling devices, channels for coordination, for load balancing and the many uses of channels of channels.</p>
        <p>The talk will be suitable for beginners and for intermediate Go programmers. All the code shown in the talk will be released.</p>

		  	As a Sysadmin, why should you learn more about Go? Well, imagine not having to mess around with old versions of Python or Ruby(I’m looking at you RHEL 5), or fall back to C when you need to improve performance. Imagine being able to deploy self-contained binaries that don’t require yet another runtime to be installed on the target system. If that sounds awesome to you, then you’re going to love Go.</p>
			<p>Using packages found in the standard library and Go’s unique language features, I’ll show you how to solve common Sysadmin problems in new ways, and set the stage for tackling a whole new set of problems that our current tools have made way too complicated.</p>
			<p>Attend Go for Sysadmins and learn how to:
			<ul>
				<li>Leverage the Go standard library for everyday system administration tasks</li>
				<li>Make practical use of goroutines and channels in system utilities and scripts</li>
				<li>Follow best practices for managing, building, and distributing Go projects</li>

			Databases have traditionally been the domain of C and C++ because of their need to squeeze every last clock cycle out of a system. But writing a whole database in C is not for the faint of heart. Luckily, we don't need to.
			<p>In this talk, I'll describe why I chose Go to write SkyDB, an open source behavioral analytics database, and some of the design choices that go into high performance Go code. We'll look at pure Go optimizations in stream processing and data access. We'll also look at integrating with cgo and external JIT tools to optimize the most performance critical code. And finally, we'll look at how to utilize Go to distribute processing across multiple cores and multiple machines.</p>

			NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform, built entirely in Go, that promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.
			<p>It was built to support bitly's data engineering systems and has continued to grow in adoption to power infrastructure at Path, Hailo, Life360, Trendrr, Simplereach, and others. It is a vibrant member of the Go open source community.</p>
			<p>Building easy-to-operate, large scale, high volume distributed systems for production tends to present unique and interesting problems that stretch ones assumptions.</p>
			<p>This talk is the product of our experience developing NSQ and operating Go services in production.</p>
			<p>It covers the evolution of bitly's infrastructure to the design and implementation of NSQ, a match made in heaven for Go. This includes the challenge of optimizing a garbage collected language, managing those pesky goroutines, and a healthy dose of distributed systems.</p>

		  	As developers, our day is spent interacting with command line applications in the terminal. Originally these tools were written in C or C++. Of late, there has been a move to languages such as Ruby, Python or Java as a way ease development of these command line applications. This move has come with increased cost to the end users in the form of OS incompatibilities or runtime interpreters that they needed to install.
		  	<p>What if you could get the ease of development without the increased cost? This talk will make the case that Go is a viable replacement for writing these command line tools. It will present real life lessons learned from the rewrite of the Cloud Foundry CLI tool from Ruby to Go. It will also show patterns that the team used to make the tool easy to test and understand from both the UI and the API interaction layers. It will finally show how to cross compile dependency free, statically linked binaries so that you can provide the users of your tool with one standalone binary to run.</p>

        Big data and analytics is becoming incredibly important as information on people and their lives become more readily available. Companies are looking for ways to acquire, store and process personal information on their users to help provide intuitive experiences and sell products or services. Using Go and Mongo, you can build these analytic engines with all the flexibility, scalability and performance you need. In my talk I will show how you can leverage Go and MongoDB to load customer data and both public or personal offer feeds at runtime. Then using a simple Go based web tool and service, build rules to identify products and services your customers will want.

			<p>
				Docker is one of the faster growing open source project. Less than 5 months after launching, the project had 60K+ users, over 6000 github stars, over 100 derivative projects, and over 150 significant contributors from around the world. Docker has been integrated into a number of key projects (Chef, Puppet, Jenkins, Travis, Vagrant, OpenStack), and has been deployed at some of the largest web properties, stirring hype and controversy in the open-source community in the process. But what the hell does a “container engine” do, and why is everyone so excited?
				<p>In this presentation, Victor Vieux, one of the core engineer of Docker, will explain the philosophy and history behind Docker, show examples of the projects built by the Docker ecosystem, and paint a picture of how Docker can change the way we think about software distribution and deployment. He will also speak about the rationale for writing Docker in Go, and the impact that has has on the project growth. In the presentation, he will show a number of examples, including how to build a open source playground for Go.</p>

		  	We have recently been working on a game called hackerbots whose server-side component we chose to author in go. We learned quite a few lessons about how to write server-side code in go along the way. A few of the things we will discuss include:
			<ul>
				<li>How to test for (and solve) leaking go routines</li>
				<li>How to use the profiler to uncover issues with your code</li>
				<li>Mixing websockets and http for game play and game control</li>
				<li>Go concepts that help us separate game state, player updates, and network traffic</li>
				<li>Optimizing JSON serialization for minimal traffic while maintaining human readability</li>
				<li>How go got in our way, and what we did to make it less painful- how to debug and fix 'frozen' server code</li>
			</ul>			
			<p>We will discuss what it is about go that really helped us write our game, with a focus on sharing stories that stand apart from the typical anecdotal reasons for choosing go.</p>
			<p>Come learn how we used the go tooling to keep our game within the constraints of a tiny virtual machine whilst having a blast doing so.</p>

			The robotics revolution has already begun. You can buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores. Unfortunately, it’s hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate multiple different kind of devices. Introducing <a href="http://gobot.io">Gobot</a>, a set of robotics libraries written in the Go programming language. Gobot can communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices, and integrate them together. With surprisingly few lines of code, you can write interesting applications that tie together Arduinos, ARDrones, Spheros, and more… even all at the same time! The time has come for Go powered robotics, and Gobot is here to help!

			Go is well-known as a rising star in building infrastructure and networked services. But it also makes an excellent choice for building developer tools that are downloaded and run on diverse, uncontrolled environments around the world. I will briefly cover why Go makes such an excellent choice for creating developer tools, but the talk will focus primarily on how to solve the most common problems unique to these tools. I will cover how to bundle non-code asset files, safely cross-compile release builds, remotely auto-update, gracefully handle crashes and more by drawing on lessons and techniques learned building my own developer tool, ngrok.

		  Despite what many compiler-fearing communities may say, Go is a 
fantastic language in which to build web services. 

This talk will start by catching everyone up on the Go standard 
library's HTTP packages, their strengths, and their weaknesses. We'll 
talk about JSON and its relationship with Go data structures, learn 
about Go's excellent support for reflection and how we can use it and 
the Go compiler to create safe APIs. 

Using some choice open-source packages we'll create higher-level APIs, 
collect metrics, and write tests. Finally, we'll get our Go web 
services into production and talk about stopping gracefully and 
restarting without downtime.
