			Rob Pike is a Distinguished Engineer at Google, Inc. He works on distributed systems, data mining, programming languages, and software development tools. Most recently he has been a co-designer and developer of the Go programming language. Before Google, Rob was a member of the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs, the lab that developed Unix. While there, he worked on computer graphics, user interfaces, languages, concurrent programming, and distributed systems. He was an architect of the Plan 9 and Inferno operating systems and is the co-author with Brian Kernighan of The Unix Programming Environment and The Practice of Programming. Other details of his life appear on line but vary in veracity.

          <p>
			Derek Collison is the founder and CEO of Apcera, a San Francisco-based company building the modern enterprise IT platform.
			<p>Derek began his career at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where he created advanced visualization applications, configured multiple computers to do the work of a supercomputer, and first encountered large-scale distributed systems. He moved to Silicon Valley shortly thereafter and in 1993, joined a startup called Teknekron Software. He would spend 12 years with the company, which became TIBCO Software. At TIBCO, Derek designed and implemented a wide range of messaging products, including Rendezvous and EMS. As TIBCO’s Senior VP and Chief Architect, Derek led technical and strategic product direction and delivery. The company grew rapidly during this period and was ranked as the largest independent integration software developer, with revenues reaching a record high of $387 million.</p>
			<p>Derek continued his pioneer engineering work as one of only two Technical Directors at Google. For Gmail, he added pictures from an email’s author. Then, he co-founded the AJAX APIs group and conceived the idea to cross-cache popular AJAX libraries through hosting on a common Google domain for all to use. During this time, Google experienced astounding growth, as revenues increased more than sevenfold to $23 billion.</p>
			<p>Next, Derek was approached with the opportunity to invent something new at virtualization giant VMware. He came up with the idea of a private Platform as a Service and was CTO of the company’s Cloud Services division, which he co-founded. A key figure in the cloud computing sphere, Derek left his mark at VMware with a career-defining invention. He designed and architected Cloud Foundry, the first and industry-leading Open PaaS that also established an ecosystem for other PaaS systems today.</p>
			<p>After over two decades in enterprise computing with first-hand experience of its limitations, Derek envisioned building a solution from the ground up that would solve today’s IT challenges as well as grow with the future. In 2012, he founded Apcera with the vision of creating a platform that drives enterprise IT to innovate faster. Today, he leads the company toward turning that vision into reality. With numerous software patents and frequent speaking engagements, Derek is a recognized leader in distributed systems design and architecture, and emerging cloud platforms. He lives in San Francisco.</p>

		  	I obtained my B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Harvard University in 2001, where my adviser was Prof. Michael Mitzenmacher. My interest in Coding Theory and Probabilistic Algorithm Design—which later reached fruition in well-received works on rateless and network coding—was born in Michael’s classes.
			<p>From 2001 to 2003, I attended the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, which resulted in my M.Sc. in Computer Science. My tastes and interests, in systems and theory, were very influenced by my adviser Prof. David Mazières—now a Stanford University professor—and Prof. Joel Spencer—a true gentleman of Mathematics. With David I completed my currently most impactful work on Kademlia: a distributed algorithm that enables billions of peers to store and discover information collaboratively.</p>
			<p>In 2012, I obtained my Ph.D. from MIT, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, happy to have been advised by Prof. Jonathan Kelner and supported by Prof. Frans Kaashoek. At MIT I concentrated on Spectral Graph Theory and its applications to distributed combinatorial and numerical algorithms. My work with Jon on electric routing is the foundation for a new generation of robust, resilient, secure and anonymous computation systems, built on top of socially-engineered often-faulty communication topologies.</p>
			<p>Following, during 2012, I worked at Tumblr, Inc. where I developed a new paradigm for efficient development and sustenance of data-processing distributed applications, The Go Circuit Project. I am interested in all aspects of distributed applications: the languages and tools we use to build them, the higher-level software metaphores we build to hide away the complex semantics of subsystem failures in distributed systems, design and analysis of numerical algorithms for pivotal problems (no pun) like solving linear systems and sketching massive structured data, even more general tools for the more challenging peer-to-peer setting.</p>
			<p>I am an avid Ashtangi and rock climber.</p>
