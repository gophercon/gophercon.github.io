    Our Diamond sponsor Google is hosting an Opening Night party at the Wynkoop Brewery.  We'll have exclusive use of the entire second floor, where you can enjoy pool tables, dart boards, table shuffleboard, ski-ball, dome hockey, and foosball.  Appetizers and some of Colorado's most award-winning microbrews will be served.
    </p>
    <p>The Wynkoop is just a short walk from the host hotel, or you can use the free busses that go up and down the 16th street mall.</p>
    <h3>Hack Day - Saturday</h3>

    Hang out with all your Gopher friends on Saturday at the hotel.  Our "Hack Day" is an unofficial day of the conference where we'll provide you with a comfortable place to hang out, socialize, organize lightning talks, or hold demonstrations of your products, services, toys, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Several companies are planning to bring surprises.  There is no official organization to this day, so come when you want and leave when you're done.  There will be no food or beverage service this day.</p>
