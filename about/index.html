    <h3>GopherCon 2014</h3>
    <p>The Go programming language is taking off. The people who were waiting for early adopters to prove out the language are flocking in droves to see why great companies like Google, Bit.ly, Heroku, Iron.io, SoundCloud, dotCloud and Canonical are putting their weight behind Go. The time is right to start building a well-organized community behind the programming language.</p>
    <p>GopherCon is the inaugural event for an annual conference devoted exclusively to the Go programming language.</p>
    <h3>Gopher Academy</h3>

      Gopher Academy's mission is to foster a community of Go developers by providing education, training, and events.
    </p>
    <p>Founded in 2012 by long time Gophers Brian Ketelsen and Erik St. Martin, Gopher Academy exists because we believe in the Go programming language.  More importantly, we see the opportunity to help shape a community that is inclusive, welcoming, helpful, and vibrant.</p>
    <p>Our first contribution to the Go community was the <a href="http://www.gopheracademy.com/jobs">Gopher Academy Job Board</a> where job postings are free, as long as they are Go jobs!</p>
