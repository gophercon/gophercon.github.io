    <h3>The First Ever Go Conference</h3>
    <p>We've created a single-track event that you won't want to miss. Opening and closing keynotes from Go luminaries will highlight the event, with twelve detailed presentations in between. Thursday and Friday will offer full days of conference sessions. Optional hack-day on Saturday allows you a day to hack with your Go friends â€” right at the conference.</p>

    <h3>Single Track</h3>
    <p>We love going to conferences that don't make you choose between two great presentations.  So we created GopherCon as a single track event, where everyone gets the opportunity to see the same talks.  We think you'll enjoy the speakers we're lining up so much you won't want to miss one of them.</p>

    <h3>Downtown Denver</h3>
    <p>Located at the foot of Colorado's beautiful front range, Denver is the ideal location for our first conference. With over three hundred days of sunshine per year, Colorado boasts some of the most breath-taking scenery you'll find in America. Denver adds world-class restaurants and great nightlife to round out your conference downtime.</p>
