    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <p>We've had several frequently asked questions, so we're putting the answers online to make it easier to get the information out.</p>
    <h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>
    <p>
    On Saturday, April 26th, we're sponsoring a Hack Day.  It's an unofficial day of the conference where there will be no formally scheduled activities.  Instead, members of the community will be organizing Lightning Talks and informal demonstrations of libraries, devices, and technologies.  Gopher Academy will be providing a comfortable space for socialization with couches, tables, chairs, and WiFi.

    <h3>Why are tickets so inexpensive?</h3>
    <p>
    We wanted to make conference that was easy to attend, and easy to afford.  Cost per attendee is higher than the posted ticket price, but we're relying on sponsorship dollars to offset the cost of attendance.  Thank our sponsors for helping to make GopherCon affordable on any budget!
    </p>
    <h3>Will the talks be recorded?</h3>
    <p>
    Yes! The awesome folks over at <a href="http://countersoft.com">Countersoft</a> have offered to sponsor the recording of the talks.  More details will be available as it's worked out.
    </p>    
    <h3>Do you offer student discounts? Military discounts?  Disenfranchised Rubyist discounts?</h3>
    <p>
    See the above question for specifics, but no.  We don't have any discounted level of tickets.  At $299, you'll be hard pressed to find a lower cost major conference anywhere.  If that's too much for you, reach out to a company that you know uses Go and offer your services in exchange for a ticket/transportation costs.  We've each gone to several conferences with arrangements like that, and you might just make connections that get you good employment in the future.  Be creative!

    <h3>What is the GopherCon Scholarship for Women?</h3>
    <p>
    We've asked members of the community to sponsor tickets to allow women who wouldn't be able to attend the opportunity to go to GopherCon.  If you'd like to BUY a ticket to support this scholarship, you can purchase them here:  <a href="https://tito.io/gophercon/gophercon-2014?release_id=wpqdsz3nwzu">GopherCon 2014 Scholarship for Women</a>.  If you'd like to be considered for the scholarship, send an email to social@gopheracademy.com.  We'll sort out the details and do everything we can to help you attend.  If you are a company and willing to help defray travel costs for a scholarship recipient, email us at social@gopheracademy.com and we'll help get you connected to an attendee who needs travel arrangements.
